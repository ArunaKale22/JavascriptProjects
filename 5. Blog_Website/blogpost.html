        In communications and information processing, code is a system of rules
        to convert information—such as a letter, word, sound, image, or
        gesture—into another form, sometimes shortened or secret, for
        communication through a communication channel or storage in a storage
        medium. An early example is an invention of language, which enabled a
        person, through speech, to communicate what they thought, saw, heard, or
        felt to others. But speech limits the range of communication to the
        distance a voice can carry and limits the audience to those present when
        the speech is uttered. The invention of writing, which converted spoken
        language into visual symbols, extended the range of communication across
        space and time.
